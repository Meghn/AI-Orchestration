The Landon advertised luxurious modern comforts and conveniences, backed by warm, sincere customer service, where guests were treated as friends. Mr. Landon, himself, liked to say \u201cWe\u2019re upscale, not uppity - and refined, not pretentious.\u201d But, most importantly, The Landon philosophy all came down to mirroring the individuality of each neighborhood within the walls of the hotel. With so many hotels within in his realm, Mr. Landon was adamant that none of the hotels should look alike, but instead that they must each take on the personality of their individual locations. He remained ardently true to his original vision until the day he died in August 1998. \n\nStill, at its core, Landon Hotel remains a community based, focusing on the specific needs of individuals and organizations in each community in which its hotels are located. \n\nThank you for your interest in Landon Hotel. We hope you enjoy our products and invite you to send us your comments and suggestions by email to feedback@landonhotel.com.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDahlia Landon & the Entire Landon Hotel family \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\tThe Story Behind THE Landon Hotel\t2\n\n\tSECTION 1: INTRODUCTION\t5\n\n\t1.1 CHANGES IN POLICY\t5\n\n\t1.2 EMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS\t5\n\n\t1.3 EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP\t5\n\n\tSECTION 2: DEFINITIONS OF EMPLOYEES STATUS\t5\n\n\t2.1 \u201cEMPLOYEES\u201d DEFINED\t5\n\n\t2.2 EXEMPT\t6\n\n\t2.3 NON-EXEMPT\t6\n\n\t2.4 REGULAR FULL-TIME\t6\n\n\t2.5 REGULAR PART-TIME\t6\n\n\t2.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1836, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b43f35d-07a2-48d8-ba9b-cccb6523f035": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b43f35d-07a2-48d8-ba9b-cccb6523f035", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Landon Hotel employee manual in Word_LIL_34022.docx", "file_path": "/Users/meghnapusala/Documents/GitHub/AI-Orchestration/2.

If you are uncertain about any policy or procedure, speak with your direct supervisor.\n\n1.2 EMPLOYMENT APPLICATIONS\n\nWe rely upon the accuracy of information contained in the employment application and the accuracy of other data presented throughout the hiring process and employment. Any misrepresentations, falsifications, or material omissions in any of this information or data may result in exclusion of the individual from further consideration for employment or, if the person has been hired, termination of employment.\n\n1.3 EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP\n\nYou enter into employment voluntarily, and you are free to resign at any time for any reason or no reason.
